# Boozer output format version 3

The binary, NetCDF, and HDF5 containers implement the same version-3 data
model. Files contain only signed integers, UTF-8 metadata, and real IEEE-754
binary64 values. Complex numbers are not part of the public format; the
complex coefficients used by the internal FFT are folded into real Fourier
parity families before writing.

## Angular coordinates

Let `zeta` and `zeta_b` denote physical source and Boozer toroidal angles. The
stored toroidal coordinate covers one field period:

```text
alpha   = nfp*zeta,
alpha_b = nfp*zeta_b.
```

The output is on the mixed grid

```text
(s, theta_b, alpha),      alpha_b = alpha + nfp*nu(theta_b, alpha),
```

where `theta_b` and `alpha` are uniform. The source field-period angle `alpha`
is unchanged by the transform. The stored `nu` is the shift in physical
toroidal radians, so the equivalent physical-angle relation is
`zeta_b = zeta + nu`. Consumers requiring a grid uniform in both Boozer angles
must invert the `alpha` to `alpha_b` map. The magnetic axis is excluded
(`first_surface=1`) because flux angles are degenerate there.

Version 2 incorrectly applied the physical-angle relation directly to its
stored field-period coordinate. Version 3 makes the units explicit and must be
used for helical Fourier diagnostics.

## Real Fourier representation

Modes are nonnegative and n-major: `n=0..nmax`, then `m=0..mmax`. The
toroidal integer is a field-period mode. The stored real amplitudes reconstruct
the mixed-grid fields as

```text
R  = sum [rmncc cos(m theta_b) cos(n alpha)
        + rmnss sin(m theta_b) sin(n alpha)]

Z  = sum [zmnsc sin(m theta_b) cos(n alpha)
        + zmncs cos(m theta_b) sin(n alpha)]

nu = sum [numnsc sin(m theta_b) cos(n alpha)
        + numncs cos(m theta_b) sin(n alpha)].
```

The transform is stellarator-symmetric: `R` is even, while `Z` and `nu` are
odd. A result whose internal spectrum does not satisfy these real parity
relations is rejected instead of serializing a lossy representation. FFTs are
unnormalized internally, but the six stored families are reconstruction
amplitudes; consumers do not apply an FFT normalization factor.

## Common data model

Every container records:

- coordinate, Fourier, source, grid, truncation, interpolation, and resonance
  metadata;
- `s[surface]`, `iota[surface]`, and `b2j00[surface]`;
- `mode_m[mode]`, `mode_n[mode]`, and the six real coefficient arrays
  `[surface][mode]`;
- real `B[surface][alpha][theta_b]` and
  `sqrt_g_b[surface][alpha][theta_b]` arrays.

The last index is contiguous. The zero mode and Jacobian obey

```text
b2j00 = integral B^2 sqrt(g_p) dtheta_p dalpha,
sqrt_g_b = b2j00 / (4*pi^2*B^2).
```

Thus `b2j00` is the unnormalized integral over the field-period angular grid,
not the flux average. The sign of `sqrt_g_b` preserves the source Jacobian
orientation.

## Binary container

The little-endian binary begins with `MCBOOZ03` and a signed 32-bit version
equal to 3. Strings are a signed 32-bit byte count followed by UTF-8 bytes.
After the metadata header, the payload order is `s`, `iota`, `mode_m`,
`mode_n`, the six coefficient families in the order shown above, `B`,
`sqrt_g_b`, and `b2j00`.

## NetCDF and HDF5 containers

NetCDF dimensions are `surface`, `theta_b`, `alpha`, and `mode`. HDF5 datasets
have the equivalent extents. Both use the common names above and root/global
attributes for metadata. Coefficients are ordinary rank-2 double arrays; no
compound datatype or real/imaginary component dimension is used.
